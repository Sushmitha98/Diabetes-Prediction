# Diabetes-Prediction
#### Use ML techniques to predict predict the likelihood of diabetes for individuals based on healthcare parameters, including blood glucose levels.
#### The following classification algorithms have been used to create the models:
1. Decision Tree
2. Logistic Regression
3. Naive Bayes classifier
4. K-Nearest Neighbors
5. Linear Discriminant Analysis
6. Ensemble of 3 best classifiers from above - Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes classifier

#### Classifier metrics for above models is as follows:
